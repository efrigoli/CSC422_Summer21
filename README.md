05/15/21 - Pushed first Milestone through the version-one branch into main. Milestone 1 establishes the pet database program with the initial functionality of displaying the table of pet data and allowing the user to add pets to the table.

05/15/21 - Pushed second Milestone through the version-two branch into main. Milestone 2 adds search functionality to the pet database, allowing the user to search records by either name or age and displaying the result table of matching records.

05/16/21 - Pushed third Milestone through the version-three branch into main. Milestone 3 adds deleting and updating capabilities to the pet database, allowing the user to update or remove records by the pet index id number.

05/17/21 - Pushed the Error Handling Milestone through the errorHandling branch into main. The Error Handling Milestone removes the search and update pet methods from the user menu as they are no longer needed. The add pet method has been refactored to loop continuously through the addition process so multiple pets can be added consecutively, up to 5 total pets in the database. Users are now required to enter a single name and a single age when adding a new pet. Age of new pets is now limited to 1-20 years. The ID input for selecting a pet to delete from the database is now limited to values of the array indexes.
